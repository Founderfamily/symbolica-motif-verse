### Migrating from Direct t() to I18nText

To convert existing code:

1. Run the conversion utility:
   ```
   node src/i18n/convert-t-to-i18ntext.js <file_path>
   ```

2. Review and finalize the automated changes

3. Run validation to ensure all translations work:
   ```
   npm run validate-translations
   ```

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases with complex string interpolation may require manual conversion
- Current tooling may not detect t() usage in complex expressions
- Visual indicators can sometimes be too subtle in complex UIs
